# SSTiPOS Support

Separate IT Backoffice repository for SSTiPOS Support.

This repository is split from `sstdevelopaminno/POS-Preview` so IT Backoffice development and Vercel deployment do not get mixed with POS/Sales work.

- GitHub repository: `sstdevelopaminno/SSTiPOSSupport`
- Vercel project/domain: `sstipos-support.vercel.app`
- Local command: `pnpm dev:it-support`
- Local URL: `http://localhost:30000/it-admin/login`
- Required Vercel surface: `APP_SURFACE=it_admin`
- Support repo fallback: when `APP_SURFACE` is missing, this repo now defaults to the IT Support surface, not POS/Sales.
- Database: same existing Supabase project/database as POS. Do not create a new Supabase project.

Keep `packages/*` and `supabase/migrations/*` synchronized with `POS-Preview` until shared packages and migrations are published through a formal release process.

## 2026-06-17 Surface Separation Audit

- `sstdevelopaminno/SSTiPOS` is the POS/Sales codebase and should continue to default to `/login/store` and POS runtime surfaces.
- `sstdevelopaminno/SSTiPOSSupport` is the IT Support codebase and must default to `/it-admin/login`.
- Root `package.json`, `apps/backoffice-web/package.json`, `.env.example`, root page redirect, login root redirect, metadata, manifest, and `src/proxy.ts` have been hardened so missing `APP_SURFACE` no longer falls back to POS/Sales in this Support repo.
- The Support deployment still needs the Vercel project environment variable `APP_SURFACE=it_admin`; the code default is a safety net, not a replacement for explicit production configuration.
- POS/Sales code, POS APIs, and shared migrations still exist in this repo until the deeper physical split is finished. They are blocked from the Support public surface by `APP_SURFACE=it_admin` and server-side IT role guards.

## Source Context

# SST iPOS / POS Platform

Production-oriented multi-tenant, multi-branch POS platform for small restaurants.

## Current Status

Improved, but not yet 100% production complete.

Before go-live, the project still needs passing evidence for typecheck, lint, login, branch selection, device selection, shift, order, payment, receipt, manual QA, deployment, and production environment checks.

### 2026-06-12 POS Sales Checkout Fix

- Fixed the takeaway checkout popup so failed bill creation no longer disappears silently; the popup now keeps the cart context, shows the error, and allows retry.
- Fixed the POS payment summary subtotal binding so checkout totals use the real cart subtotal instead of the discount amount.
- Hardened POS order creation replay responses so the frontend receives usable bill totals, tax lines, and status for the next payment step.
- Enabled the active production demo tenant scope for `core_pos_sales` by adding an active Starter contract after the POS API returned `feature_not_enabled`.
- Fixed the checkout error modal actions by restoring pointer events and resetting the checkout request lock before close/retry.
- Polished the bank-transfer payment popup sizing: smaller QR, smaller tax line, tighter spacing, and better fit in the modal viewport.

### Next Handoff

The next development pass should start with IT backoffice work and keep POS sales changes to bug fixes only unless explicitly requested. Use `docs/AI-HANDOFF-IT-BACKOFFICE-2026-06-12.md` as the bootstrap for the next chat.

## Stack

## Deployment surface model

POS/Sales and IT Backoffice must run as separate Vercel Projects and separate domains. Do not expose IT Backoffice from the POS/Sales public URL.

- POS/Sales: Vercel Project example `sstipos-pos`, domain example `pos.<domain>`, `APP_SURFACE=pos`.
- IT Backoffice: Vercel Project `sstipos-support`, display name `SSTiPOS Support`, domain example `admin.<domain>` or `it.<domain>`, `APP_SURFACE=it_admin`.
- Local full-surface development only: `APP_SURFACE=all`.
- Local IT Backoffice preview: run with `APP_SURFACE=it_admin` and `PORT=30000`, then open `http://localhost:30000/it-admin/login`.
- POS local command in the POS repo: `pnpm dev` or `pnpm dev:pos`.
- IT local command in this Support repo: `pnpm dev` or `pnpm dev:it-support`.

The IT Backoffice uses a separate Vercel Project/domain, but it must use the same Supabase project/database as POS. Do not create a separate Supabase project for IT Backoffice. Configure the IT Vercel project with the same Supabase URL, anon key, server-only service role key, and any required auth/session secrets used by the POS project.

Repository split planning is tracked in `docs/future-repository-separation-plan.md`.

- POS GitHub repository: `sstdevelopaminno/POS-Preview`
- IT GitHub repository: `sstdevelopaminno/SSTiPOSSupport`
- Until shared packages are published separately, keep `packages/*` and `supabase/migrations/*` synchronized in both repositories.
- Treat Supabase migrations as one canonical history; do not add an IT-only database fork.

Surface isolation is prepared in `apps/backoffice-web/src/proxy.ts` with optional host allowlists:
- `POS_ALLOWED_HOSTS=pos.<domain>`
- `IT_ADMIN_ALLOWED_HOSTS=admin.<domain>,it.<domain>`

Root `vercel.json` points Vercel builds to `apps/backoffice-web/.next` for root-level deploys. The app-level `apps/backoffice-web/vercel.json` remains available for projects whose Vercel Root Directory is already `apps/backoffice-web`.

Security must still be enforced server-side. The IT admin layout and `/api/it-admin/*` guards resolve authenticated platform roles server-side and allow only `it_admin` or `it_support`; POS APIs continue to resolve tenant, branch, device, session, permission, contract, and feature state server-side.

No Vercel deploy is performed by documentation or audit passes unless explicitly requested. Future production setup must configure separate environment variables and production aliases per Vercel Project. Do not run `vercel --prod` for IT preview verification.

## IT Backoffice roles

IT staff must use `/it-admin/login` on the IT Backoffice project/domain, not the POS store login.

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| `it_admin` | Full IT Backoffice access, including feature flags, branch overrides, devices, customer display devices, platform users, and settings. |
| `it_support` | Limited support access: tenants, branches, package contract/subscription, user branch roles except delete/deactivate, active sessions, shifts, audit review, monitoring/readiness, and package quote/catalog. |
| `tenant_user` | No IT Backoffice access. |

The `platform_role` database enum includes `it_support` via `supabase/migrations/20260612132854_add_it_support_platform_role.sql`. Server-side IT API guards enforce the role/menu matrix; hiding navigation is not treated as authorization.

`/it-admin/login` now presents the first `SSTiPOS Support` UI pass for the separated IT Backoffice project/domain:
- split white/blue login card for desktop and stacked responsive layout for mobile/tablet
- email/password login tab backed by the existing server-side Supabase Auth + platform role check
- QR login tab placeholder only; QR auth is not implemented yet
- Thai/English loading, error, invalid-role, session-expired, signed-out, and success states
- preferred logo path: `apps/backoffice-web/public/brand/sstipos-support-logo.png`; a placeholder copied from the existing SST iPOS logo is committed for preview and should be replaced with the real `SSTiPOS Support` logo before brand QA/production promotion

No Vercel command or deployment was run for this UI pass.

Development IT platform users can be created or refreshed with `apps/backoffice-web/scripts/create-it-platform-users.mjs`. It uses the same Supabase project/database env as POS and reads only these credential env var names: `SST_IT_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `SST_IT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `SST_IT_SUPPORT_EMAIL`, and `SST_IT_SUPPORT_PASSWORD`. Do not commit real credential values.

Login usability note: `/it-admin/login` clears stale invalid-role/error state when the user edits the form, times out stalled login requests, and clears any existing Supabase session before signing in an IT staff account. This keeps old POS/tenant_user cookies from blocking IT Support login retries.

IT menu note: the IT shell displays `SSTiPOS Support`, shows the current IT role, and avoids duplicate tenant/store menu entries. Menu visibility is still derived from server-resolved permissions.

IT role menu note: `it_support` sees only support operations: tenants, branches, package contracts, users/roles, active sessions, shifts, audit review, and monitoring/readiness. `it_admin` also sees feature flags/branch overrides, devices/registration, customer display devices, platform users, and settings.

IT UI note: the IT Backoffice now uses a modern office dashboard shell with left sidebar navigation, mobile drawer navigation, top bar account/language controls, role badge, and the SST Innovation logo at `apps/backoffice-web/public/brand/sst-innovation-logo.png`.

## Business coverage included
- POS sales/orders/receipts
- Dine-in table flows and takeaway
- Manual delivery channels (Grab, LINE MAN, Shopee, Merchant App, Other)
- Cash and bank transfer payment models
- Product/ingredient/recipe/stock movement models
- Shift open/close with mismatch and unpaid bill guardrails
- Staff/manager/owner/it_admin/it_support role model
- Back office and IT admin UI routes
- Audit logging foundation
- Store + POS secure login flow (store -> branch -> employee -> device) now runs in `backoffice-web`
- IT Backoffice login is prepared separately at `/it-admin/login`; do not reuse POS store login for IT staff.

Current login and POS entry flow:

```text
/login/store -> /login/branches or /login/employee -> /login/devices -> /preview/pos
```

QR scan login was removed from the active runtime flow. Historical QR references are archive-only.

## Critical Safety Rules

- Never trust client-sent `tenant_id`, `branch_id`, `store_code`, `device_code`, `owner_id`, or `role`.
- Resolve tenant, branch, device, POS session, user, role, and permissions server-side.
- Keep Supabase service-role usage server-only.
- Preserve tenant isolation and branch scope on every sensitive operation.
- Preserve login context security, shift gate, audit logging, and auth/public rate limiting.
- POS order/payment totals must remain server/database authoritative.

## Core Features

- Store login, branch selection, employee verification, device selection
- POS session and shift gate before sales
- Takeaway, dine-in, and manual delivery order flows
- Cash and bank transfer payments
- Receipt preview and print flow
- Product, recipe, ingredient, and stock movement model
- Table QR customer ordering
- POS users, devices, payment settings, tax settings
- Back office and IT admin routes
- Audit logging and production readiness docs

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Configure environment:

```text
apps/backoffice-web/.env.local
```

Use `apps/backoffice-web/.env.example` as the template. Never commit real secrets.

Supabase migration-ready env structure:

- `SUPABASE_PRIMARY_URL`, `SUPABASE_PRIMARY_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_PRIMARY_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_ARCHIVE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ARCHIVE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `HOT_DATA_RETENTION_MONTHS=12`, `ENABLE_ARCHIVE_READS=false`, `ENABLE_DUAL_DB_MODE=false`

During transition, existing Supabase env names may temporarily point to the primary database.

3. Apply Supabase migrations:

```bash
supabase db push
```

4. Seed demo data when needed:

```bash
psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" -f supabase/seed.sql
```

5. Start local app:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

6. Open:

```text
http://localhost:30000/it-admin/login
```

In this Support repository, `pnpm dev` defaults to `APP_SURFACE=it_admin` and `PORT=30000`.
POS/Sales local routes belong in the POS repository, not this Support runtime.

## Demo Login Pointers

Current seeded/demo access details change over time. Check `context.md` before testing production or preview flows.

Common demo flow:

```text
store code -> branch -> employee code/PIN -> device -> POS shift -> sale
```

## Required Verification

Run these before handing off code changes when the local Node environment is available:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

For broader release checks:

```bash
npm run build
```

Manual POS QA should cover:

- Login flow
- Branch/device selection
- Shift open/join/close
- Order create
- Payment complete
- Receipt preview/print
- Stock deduction
- Table QR ordering when touched

For Support-only changes, verify the IT surface instead:

- `/` redirects to `/it-admin/login`
- `/it-admin/login` loads on the Support project/domain
- POS routes such as `/login/store` redirect away from the Support surface
- `/sw.js` serves the cleanup worker with no-store cache headers

## Key Documents

* If no orders exist, debug the POS checkout/order creation flow first.
* If orders exist but no `order_items`, debug order item insert.
* If orders and items exist but `recipe_lines = 0`, repair product recipe/stock bridge setup.
* If `recipe_lines > 0` but no `stock_movements`, debug the stock deduction execution path in `pos-sales-service`.
* If `stock_movements` exists but UI stock does not change, debug stock UI refresh/cache.

## Next Development Focus: IT Backoffice

The next development pass focuses on IT backoffice/admin work. Start from:

- `context.md`
- `docs/AI-HANDOFF-IT-BACKOFFICE-2026-06-12.md`
- `apps/backoffice-web/src/app/(it-admin)/`
- `apps/backoffice-web/src/components/it-admin/`
- `apps/backoffice-web/src/app/api/it-admin/`

No Vercel deploy should be run during the planning pass.

## GitHub Documentation Sync Rule

For every future code change, system fix, or development pass:

- Update the relevant repo documentation in the same branch.
- Include the current status, changed files, verification results, risks, and next recommended steps.
- Push the documentation updates to GitHub so the planning chat can read the latest repo state before sending the next Codex command.
- Do not deploy or run Vercel unless the user explicitly asks for deployment.

## IT Backoffice Audit Update (2026-06-12)

The latest IT Backoffice/Admin audit is documented in `docs/AI-HANDOFF-IT-BACKOFFICE-2026-06-12.md`.

Next implementation should start with P1 guardrails:

- tenant package/contract/`core_pos_sales` readiness
- branch feature override scope validation
- user role branch/user validation
- contract plan validation
- targeted IT admin permission, scope, feature gate, and quota tests

No Vercel deploy should be run for this planning/audit pass.

### 2026-06-14 SSTiPOS Support split status
- SSTiPOS Support is developed in the separate `SSTiPOSSupport` repo/branch while POS remains in `POS-Preview`.
- Both POS and SSTiPOS Support use the same existing Supabase project/database; do not create a new Supabase project.
- Vercel deploys are separated by project: POS uses the POS project, SSTiPOS Support uses the `sstipos-support` project with `APP_SURFACE=it_admin`.
- `it_admin` keeps full IT access; `it_support` is limited to tenant, branch, contract/subscription, users/roles, sessions, shifts, audit review, and monitoring/readiness.
- `it_support` must not hard delete, manage feature flags, manage devices, manage platform users, change IT admin roles, or edit/delete raw audit logs.
- Keep service-role secrets server-only and never commit `.env.local`.
### 2026-06-14 Supabase migration applied
- Applied `supabase/migrations/20260612132854_add_it_support_platform_role.sql` against the existing shared Supabase DB `deejlitaivfnsbwqdugy`.
- Verification confirmed `platform_role` contains `it_admin`, `it_support`, and `tenant_user`.
- No new Supabase project/database was created.
- DB password was used only for the CLI process and was not written to repository files.

### 2026-06-16 GitHub main sync and Vercel production deploy
- Root cause checked: GitHub `main` still pointed to the initial README-only commit while the full SSTiPOS Support code was on `split/it-support-project`.
- Fast-forwarded `main` to `split/it-support-project` and pushed `main` to `sstdevelopaminno/SSTiPOSSupport`.
- Added commit `18d4de6` to align `apps/backoffice-web/next-env.d.ts` with the current Next.js build route type output path.
- Verification before deploy:
  - `pnpm --filter backoffice-web typecheck` passed.
  - ESLint passed when run without cache; cached lint was blocked locally by sandbox/write permission on `.eslintcache`.
  - Local production build produced `.next`, but the local command timed out before returning a final exit code. Vercel production build completed successfully.
- Deployed production with Vercel CLI to project `sstipos-support`.
- Production deployment: `https://sstipos-support-d1317t7r3-sstdevelopaminnos-projects.vercel.app`
- Production alias: `https://sstipos-support.vercel.app`
- HTTP checks returned `200` for `/` and `/it-admin/login`.
- Post-deploy error scan showed one unauthenticated `HEAD /it-admin` redirect log; this is likely auth-guard noise, but it should be downgraded from error-level logging in a future cleanup if it affects monitoring.

### 2026-06-17 SSTiPOS Support production env sync
- Confirmed the `sstipos-support` Vercel project is separate from the POS `sstipos` project/domain.
- Synced the required Supabase runtime env vars from the POS local env source into Vercel production for `sstipos-support` so IT Support uses the same Supabase project/database as POS.
- Synced only variable names into documentation; secret values were not printed or committed.
- Redeployed production after the env sync. Production alias remains `https://sstipos-support.vercel.app`.
- Verified `itadmin@sstipos.local` exists in Supabase Auth, is email-confirmed, has `app_metadata.platform_role=it_admin`, and has an active `users_profiles` row with `platform_role=it_admin`.
- Verified HTTP routing separation after deploy:
  - Support root redirects to `/it-admin/login`.
  - Support `/login/store` redirects to `/it-admin/login?blocked=pos_surface`.
  - Support `/it-admin/login` returns `200`.
  - POS `https://sstipos-ten.vercel.app/login/store` still returns `200`.

### 2026-06-17 Support stale service worker cleanup
- Root cause suspected for Chrome showing a blank loading tab on `sstipos-support.vercel.app`: the Support domain still served an older POS Preview service worker that cached `/` and POS shell assets.
- Replaced `public/sw.js` with a self-removing cleanup worker that deletes Cache Storage and unregisters itself.
- Updated `PwaBootstrap` to delete Cache Storage after unregistering any existing service workers.
- Added `no-store` headers for `/sw.js` so browsers fetch the cleanup worker instead of reusing the old POS cache.
- This is specific to the Support project; POS PWA/offline details can be revisited later in the POS repo.
- Hardening follow-up: Support no longer advertises the PWA manifest/apple web app metadata, the file-based `app/manifest.ts` route was removed from this Support repo, and Support entry responses use no-store cache headers. `Clear-Site-Data` is intentionally limited to `/sw.js` so Chrome does not clear storage during every login page navigation.
- Production redeploy after removing `app/manifest.ts`: `https://sstipos-support-a9k14hunr-sstdevelopaminnos-projects.vercel.app`, aliased to `https://sstipos-support.vercel.app`.
- Post-deploy verification: `/` redirects to `/it-admin/login` with no-store cache headers, `/it-admin/login` returns `200` without a manifest link, `/sw.js` returns the cleanup worker with no-store headers, and `/manifest.webmanifest` returns `404`.

### 2026-06-17 Support login navigation fix
- Root cause investigated for Chrome opening `about:blank` or hanging when launching the Support domain from Vercel: Support entry redirects and `/it-admin/login` were sending `Clear-Site-Data: "cache", "storage"` on every navigation.
- Limited `Clear-Site-Data` to `/sw.js` only. Root redirects, `/it-admin/login`, and blocked POS route redirects now send no-store cache headers without clearing origin storage during page load.
- Changed files: `apps/backoffice-web/next.config.ts`, `apps/backoffice-web/src/proxy.ts`, and this README.
- Verification before deploy: `npm run typecheck` passed, targeted ESLint for `next.config.ts` and `src/proxy.ts` passed, and `npm run build` passed.
